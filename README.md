# SC-FROCRT
SC-FROCRT Reconstruction
This repository contains the implementation of the SC-FROCRT (Sparse Continuous Full-Range Optical Coherence Refraction Tomography) reconstruction framework. This method is designed for high-resolution, full-range, and isotropic OCT imaging. The repository will be in continued development as we work to refine and expand the functionality of the method.

Method Overview
SC-FROCRT incorporates three key modules:

Super-Resolution Iterative Module: Based on sample priors, this module enhances resolution by iteratively reconstructing the image.
Conjugate Artifact Removal Module: Effectively removes conjugate artifacts that commonly arise in traditional OCT systems.
Isotropic Reconstruction Module: Aims to achieve isotropic resolution by combining multi-angle information using Fourier synthesis.
Current Version
The current version of this repository provides Matlab demo code for the following two modules:
Conjugate Artifact Removal Module
Super-Resolution Iterative Module

The Isotropic Reconstruction Module code can be adapted from K. C. Zhouâ€™s implementation of optical coherence refraction tomography (OCRT). You can find the relevant code at this GitHub repository: K. C. Zhou, "Computational 3D microscopy with optical coherence refraction tomography (OCRT)," Github (2022).
